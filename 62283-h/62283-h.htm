</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Anticipating the present tendency
of the American people
toward a healthful method of living
and enjoyment, Spalding’s Athletic
Library was established in 1892 for
the purpose of encouraging athletics
in every form, not only by
publishing the official rules and
records pertaining to the various
pastimes, but also by instructing,
until to-day Spalding’s Athletic
Library is unique in its own particular
field and has been conceded
the greatest educational series on
athletic and physical training subjects
that has ever been compiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>The publication of a distinct
series of books devoted to athletic
sports and pastimes and designed
to occupy the premier place in
America in its class was an early
idea of Mr. A. G. Spalding, who
was one of the first in America
to publish a handbook devoted to
athletic sports, Spalding’s Official
Base Ball Guide being the initial
number, which was followed at intervals with other handbooks on the
sports prominent in the ’70s.</p>

<p class='c005'>Spalding’s Athletic Library has had the advice and counsel of Mr. A. G.
Spalding in all of its undertakings, and particularly in all books devoted
to the national game. This applies especially to Spalding’s Official
Base Ball Guide and Spalding’s Official Base Ball Record, both of which
receive the personal attention of Mr. A. G. Spalding, owing to his early
connection with the game as the leading pitcher of the champion Boston
and Chicago teams of 1872–76. His interest does not stop, however, with
matters pertaining to base ball; there is not a sport that Mr. Spalding
does not make it his business to become familiar with, and that the
Library will always maintain its premier place, with Mr. Spalding’s able
counsel at hand, goes without saying.</p>

<p class='c005'>The entire series since the issue of the first number has been under
the direct personal supervision of Mr. James E. Sullivan, President
of the American Sports Publishing Company, and the total series of
consecutive numbers reach an aggregate of considerably over three
hundred, included in which are many “annuals,” that really constitute
the history of their particular sport in America year by year, back copies
of which are even now eagerly sought for, constituting as they do the
really first authentic records of events and official rules that have ever
been consecutively compiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Spalding’s Athletic Library was founded, seventeen years ago,
track and field athletics were practically unknown outside the larger
colleges and a few athletic clubs in the leading cities, which gave occasional
meets, when an entry list of 250 competitors was a subject of comment;
golf was known only by a comparatively few persons; lawn tennis
had some vogue and base ball was practically the only established field
sport, and that in a professional way; basket ball had just been invented;
athletics for the schoolboy—and schoolgirl—were almost unknown, and
an advocate of class contests in athletics in the schools could not get a
hearing. To-day we find the greatest body of athletes in the world is
the Public Schools Athletic League of Greater New York, which has had
an entry list at its annual games of over two thousand, and in whose
“elementary series” in base ball last year 106 schools competed for the
trophy emblematic of the championship.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Spalding’s Athletic Library cannot claim that the rapid growth
of athletics in this country is due to it solely, the fact cannot be denied
that the books have had a great deal to do with its encouragement, by
printing the official rules and instructions for playing the various games
at a nominal price, within the reach of everyone, with the sole object
that its series might be complete and the one place where a person
could look with absolute certainty for the particular book in which he
might be interested.</p>

<p class='c005'>In selecting the editors and writers for the various books, the leading
authority in his particular line has been obtained, with the result
that no collection of books on athletic subjects can compare with
Spalding’s Athletic Library for the prominence of the various authors
and their ability to present their subjects in a thorough and practical
manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>A short sketch of a few of those who have edited some of the leading
numbers of Spalding’s Athletic Library is given herewith:</p>

<p class='c005'>For quarter of a century Mr. Walter Camp
of Yale has occupied a leading position in college
athletics. It is immaterial what organization
is suggested for college athletics, or for
the betterment of conditions, insofar as college
athletics is concerned, Mr. Camp has always
played an important part in its conferences,
and the great interest in and high plane of
college sport to-day, are undoubtedly due more
to Mr. Camp than to any other individual. Mr.
Camp has probably written more on college
athletics than any other writer and the leading papers and magazines
of America are always anxious to secure his expert opinion on foot
ball, track and field athletics, base ball and rowing. Mr. Camp has grown
up with Yale athletics and is a part of Yale’s remarkable athletic system.
While he has been designated as the “Father of Foot Ball,” it is a well
known fact that during his college career Mr. Camp was regarded as one
of the best players that ever represented Yale on the base ball field, so
when we hear of Walter Camp as a foot ball expert we must also remember
his remarkable knowledge of the game of base ball, of which he is a
great admirer. Mr. Camp has edited Spalding’s Official Foot Ball Guide
since it was first published, and also the Spalding Athletic Library book
on How to Play Foot Ball. There is certainly no man in American college
life better qualified to write for Spalding’s Athletic Library than Mr.
Camp.</p>

  <h2 id='AMATEURS' class='c010'>TUMBLING FOR AMATEURS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Teachers, especially in public gymnasia, where the attendance
is voluntary, will welcome anything that will make the
exercises more attractive and do away, as far as possible,
with the idea of “work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tumbling should form a part of every system taught in our
public gymnasia, and to those who have not heretofore
studied the subject we submit the following propositions:</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Tumbling will develop, harmoniously, the whole body
without the aid of any apparatus whatever, or any other set
of exercises. A careful study of the physiques of professional
tumblers will verify this statement.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The exercises can be easily graded, so that there will be
absolutely no danger in going from primary to advanced
tumbling. In individual tumbling, the body being always
close to the ground, the chances of a break or a sprain are
reduced to a minimum; and in comparison with other forms
of exercise, such as boxing, wrestling, or apparatus work,
the percentage of accidents will be found to compare most
favorably.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Friends can enter into the keenest competition, urging
each other to the highest possible development and perfection,
and never experience the inconveniences of black eyes
and bruises—the usual resultants of combative exercises.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. At least 50 per cent. of those entering the gymnasium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>can participate in some form of tumbling, either individual
or combination; the greatest progress for adults being attained
in the latter, where two or more men exercise together.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. No expensive appliances or apparatus is necessary in
introducing or teaching tumbling, the mats absolutely essential
in any gymnasium being all-sufficient for ordinary class
work. But if tumbling is to be made a feature, then a large
mat, 15 feet long by 6 feet wide and 2 feet high and stuffed
with straw or hay, will be found a very attractive addition,
as it can be used to great advantage with any gymnastic apparatus.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. For boys, tumbling is the most natural exercise in the
world, as they are easily interested and held in this form of
exercise when a dumb-bell drill would run them away. Besides
the development, they get co-ordination and control to
a remarkable extent, which will be invaluable to them in any
exercise that they may engage in later on.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. A tumbler easily adapts himself to all gymnastic apparatus,
and will usually be found to be more graceful than
an exclusive apparatus worker. If teachers who have never
used tumbling would introduce it, it would do away, in a
great measure, with that stiffness which is so distasteful to
many; and, if as systematically taught as their apparatus
work, would change the product of their gymnasiums from the
top-heavy type to a symmetrical whole.</p>

<p class='c005'>8. It is the one universal exercise used by the whole human
family from the earliest times to the dawn of the twentieth
century, and will continue in use as long as the world lasts.
The millions of babies tumbling in the world to-day, learning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>their first physical exercise—to walk—reminds us that we
have all taken a few lessons, at least, in this most useful art.</p>

<p class='c005'>9. Tumbling is of more importance than all other exercises,
as, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</span></i>, we all take a tumble occasionally; and if
we know how to tumble—so as to land on our feet or keep
from falling—it will give us a confidence that we would not
otherwise have. There seems to be a very prevalent idea
that if a man has never learned how to tumble before he is
twenty-one he had just as well not start. On the contrary, if
a person has never taken gymnastic exercises, he can make
greater advancement in tumbling than in almost any other
form of exercise, if his physique permits of tumbling at all.
After acquiring a few of the exercises, tumbling can be practiced
with pleasure and satisfaction on any lawn, sand-bar,
or sawdust pile, and in this way will prove of more practical
utility than almost any form of gymnastics.</p>

<p class='c005'>A word of caution might not be out of place: In teaching
adults (where a large mat, such as already described, is not
used) the small mats cannot be piled too high to prevent
jars and shocking surprises. If pupils suffer from dizziness,
excuse them from these exercises. In combination tumbling
the belt, or lunger, must always be put on for a first trial,
however simple the exercise may appear.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the following pages I have depended almost entirely
upon the illustrations, and have intentionally made the text
as short and concise as possible—following the plan of
Messrs. Hitchcock and Nelligan’s most excellent work,
“Wrestling.” I am also indebted to Dr. William Anderson,
of Yale University, for many valuable suggestions.</p>

  <h2 id='ADVANCED' class='c010'>ADVANCED TUMBLING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Note.—Advanced tumbling should never be attempted alone
the first time. A belt, with an assistant on either side, is the
usual method of practising these exercises. Do not hurry. Practise
one movement day after day until you are proficient, remembering
that a difficult movement once mastered is as simple
as any other, and that after learning you can execute them
with ease and impunity. It is folly, not bravery, to attempt
movements by yourself that you are not sure of; and you are
the one to decide this, not others.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. <b>Back Somersault.</b> From standing position, hands by the
side, spring straight up (do not bend forward as you stoop
for spring), throwing hands high above head; throw the head
back, and, grasping the knees, pull them well in at the highest
point of jump, at the same time kicking the feet forward; let
out, and come down straight. Fig. <a href='#f21'>21</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. From a hand stand snap to feet and a back somersault.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Round off and a back somersault.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Two, three, or four back somersaults in a swing.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. Forward run and back somersault.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. Cart-wheel, round off, and back.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. <b>Front Somersault.</b> Run forward, and as you run increase
your speed; spring from either right or left foot a distance of
from 8 to 12 feet, landing on the balls of both feet, hands by
the side (Fig. <a href='#f70'>70</a>), chest out, and head erect (not forward);
jump for height, lifting the body by a quick upward swing of
the arms, and at the highest point of the jump throw head
and hands down with a snap, grasp the legs a short distance
below the knees and pull in close and hard, doubling up close,
then straighten out quickly and alight on balls of feet in erect
position. Fig. <a href='#f21'>22</a>.</p>

<div id='f34'  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>

</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Note.—Make the jump for height the fastest part of the
run, and as you jump increase your speed so as to get the
greatest height attainable, double into as small a ball as possible,
and then let out and come down perfectly straight, and
you have the ideal somersault.</p>

<p class='c005'>8.  <b>Standing Front Somersault.</b> Hands by the sides (Fig.
70), spring straight upward, lifting with arms and shoulders,
and as you reach the limit of your height throw head and
hands forward with a snap, grasping ankles and pulling in
close; then let out again quickly.</p>

<p class='c005'>9.  <b>The Layout Front Somersault.</b> (Done principally from
the spring-board, although a few exceptionally fine jumpers
can do it from the mat.) As you rise for the somersault
throw the hands well out in front, with arms perfectly stiff,
head up, chest out; hold this position for a second, then make
a quick, close double as in the ordinary somersault; let out
and come down straight.</p>

<p class='c005'>10.  <b>One Foot Front.</b> Stand on one foot and execute regular
somersault.</p>

<p class='c005'>11.  <b>Knee Front.</b> From kneeling position raise to feet, regular
somersault.</p>

tumbling exercises). From standing position raise the heels,
bend the knees, let the hands go back past sides, keep the
body, from waist up, straight, stoop until hands can nearly
touch the mat; from this position throw the hands swiftly
forward and upward, at the same time raise on toes (but do
not jump at all), arching the back well in, head and arms
thrown as far back as possible; pull the body over by momentum
of shoulders, body, and head. Figs. <a href='#f21'>23</a>, <a href='#f21'>24</a>, <a href='#f21'>25</a>.</p>

  <h2 id='COMBINATION' class='c010'>COMBINATION TUMBLING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>By this is meant a series of combinations by two or more
men exercising together. In these exercises a belt must always
be put on for the first trial (or assistants stand on
either side), however simple the exercises may appear, and
must be kept on until the exercise is thoroughly mastered,
which would mean that you have each other’s time and act
in unison. Work with the same men all the time; beware
of strangers, even if both of you understand the exercises.
Do not be afraid to use caution and common sense. Only
combinations that can be mastered by business men with limited
time have been put in; the more dangerous ones, requiring
much time, being intentionally omitted. In all of the
following exercises No. 1 is the heaviest or “bottom” man;
No. 2, “middle” man; and No. 3, “top” man (or lightest man).</p>

<h3 class='c011'>ELEPHANT WALK.</h3>

<p class='c012'>1. Stand facing each other. No. 2 puts hands on No. 1’s
shoulders, springs up and throws legs around No. 1’s waist,
then leans backward and drops between No. 1’s legs, who then
bends forward and places hands on floor keeping knees stiff;
No. 2 places hands on No. 1’s heels and straightens arms;
No. 1 then walks off (also with a small boy on top), or untwists
legs and both do a roll over. Fig. <a href='#f26'>26</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>HAND STAND ROLL.</h3>

<p class='c012'>3. No. 1 stands erect; No. 2 makes hand stand close to No.
1’s heels, his legs dropping over No. 1’s shoulders, who grasps
No. 2’s ankles, bends forward, quickly pulling No. 2 over to a
standing position; No. 1 now does a hand stand and is thrown
over by No. 2. Repeat in quick succession. For first part of
movement see Fig. <a href='#f97'>99</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>DOUBLE ROLL.</h3>

<p class='c012'>4. No. 1 lies on back, legs raised to vertical, with knees
slightly bent, and grasps No. 2’s ankles, who stands close to
his head and also grasps No. 1’s ankles; No. 2 dives forward,
held back slightly by No. 1 to break his fall; continue roll.

<p class='c014'>W. G. Anderson, Associate Director Yale University Gymnasium:
“I believe in ‘tumbling’ as an exercise. It makes a
man quick, agile, and very sure-footed. It is a form of sport
that is popular and perfectly legitimate when properly taught.
We have no good book on the subject, but need one. If such
a work is to be presented to those interested in this subject, it
ought to be written by a man who has had much experience
in actual tumbling, who is familiar with the mechanism of the
body, and who is educated. Dr. James T. Gwathmey, of Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, Tenn., is just the person to

physician. I have looked over the MS. of the Doctor’s new
book, and I indorse it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>R. Tait McKenzie, M.D.: “I am glad to find some one
ready and able to draw the veil from a branch of gymnastics
which the professional acrobat has so long kept shrouded in
mystery. The reducing of the various feats of tumbling to a
progressive sequence, and the analyzing of the various combinations,
is indeed a difficult task; but your kinetoscope
method of illustration will make clear what would otherwise
require pages of description. Your work can not but assist
any one of ordinary ability in mastering the rudiments of the
art; but it will also appeal to the much wider field of all who
admire acrobatics, and will give them some idea of the difficulties
mastered by the professional, whose work they will
more fully appreciate. I wish your book every success.”</p>

<p class='c014'>E. Hitchcock, M.D., Amherst College, Pratt Gymnasium:
“In physical education, as in many other branches of mental
and bodily training, there are some advanced branches which
are adapted to the few and not the many. Acrobatic work is
one of these. But it should be controlled, cultivated, and made
good use of, like the other work, which may be undertaken by
anybody. It is a pleasure to know that a manual on this subject
is to be prepared and furnished for our use by one so
capable to issue the book as is Dr. Gwathmey, of Vanderbilt
University. We shall wait impatiently to get hold of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>R. F. Nelligan, Instructor, Amherst College: “For sound
men and boys tumbling is one of the best and most exhilarating
of exercises, when practised under favorable conditions.
Of course tumbling on a brick sidewalk differs from
tumbling on a hair-stuffed mattress, with the aid of the safety
appliances while learning. It has been said that one can not
learn after reaching maturity. This is not so, as many first-class
tumblers did not commence until after reaching twenty-five.
At the age of thirty-two I was induced to take up tumbling
under Dr. Gwathmey, and, with the aid of his safety appliances, succeeded in learning to do fairly well over fifty
different movements and combinations.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Carl Betz, Supervisor Music and Physical Training, Public
Schools: “Your book, ‘Tumbling for Amateurs,’ which you
have announced, will undoubtedly be hailed with delight by
thousands of young American men who seek and find recreation
in this particular kind of exercise. The photographs that
will illuminate the pages of your book will be of intrinsic
value to amateurs, who usually have no expert teacher to explain
to them minutely each step of the exercise. If the element
of danger in tumbling is greater than is consistent with
the needs of physical education, as some claim it is, then
your book, giving such minute instructions, and photographs
of the body passing through the different stages of each exercise,
cannot fail to reduce that danger to a degree which
every interesting gymnastic exercise must contain. I therefore
cheerfully recommend your interesting and timely little
book to all who may wish to learn and practice the delightful
pastime of tumbling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“One of the aims of
physical training is to
make exercise interesting
and enjoyable. To be
beneficial in the highest
sense it must be recreative.
Particularly is this
true of physical exercise
for business men. As a
class, in their daily work,
they are kept on a constant
mental strain. Besides,
they are, to a large
degree, physically inactive.
Life becomes too
intense, too serious, too
sordid. Exercise therefore,
for business men,
must be largely recreative,
relaxing and restful.”—<i>Extract
from Spalding
Athletic Library, No. 262—“Exercises
with the
Medicine Ball.”</i></p>

the most perfect rowing machine ever

having a three-inch adjustment, to suit either a tall or a short person. By turning
a thumb-nut the belt can be tightened to any desired degree, and more or less friction
thrown into the running parts, imitating the resistance which exists when forcing a
row-boat through the water. The weaker sex can use the machine by simply loosening the thumb-nut which
reduces the resistance; and on the other hand, by reversing the operation the resistance can be so increased
that the strongest athlete can have any amount of resistance. The oars are pivoted in such a way that the operator
can handle and turn them the same as he would during the return and feathering motion with a boat oar.</p>

<p class='c005'>Acting on the suggestion of one of the most prominent athletic
officials in this country, we decided recently to get up a boxing
glove that would be an aid to the pupil learning to box. This
glove is additionally padded on the forearm and over the wrist,
to prevent that soreness which is one of the most discouraging
features following a brisk lesson in the art of “blocking.”
The glove part is well padded with curled hair, the leather being best quality soft tanned.</p>

    <div>Durand-Steel Lockers</div>

<p>Some of the 6,000 Durand-Steel Lockers installed in the Public Gymnasiums of Chicago. 12″ × 15″ × 42″, Double Tier.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><b>Wooden lockers are objectionable</b>,
because they attract vermin, absorb odors,
can be easily broken into, and are dangerous
on account of fire.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Lockers made from wire mesh or
expanded metal afford little security</b>,
as they can be easily entered with wire cutters.
Clothes placed in them become covered
with dust, and the lockers themselves present
a poor appearance, resembling animal cages.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Durand-Steel Lockers</b> are made of finest
grade furniture steel and are finished with
gloss black, furnace-baked japan (400°), comparable
to that used on hospital ware, which will never flake
off nor require refinishing, as do paints and enamels.</p>

<div  class='figleft id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Three Lockers in Single Tier</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><b>Durand-Steel Lockers</b> are usually built with
doors perforated full length in panel design with sides
and backs solid. This prevents clothes in one locker
from coming in contact with wet garments
in adjoining lockers, while plenty of ventilation
is secured by having the door perforated
its entire length, but, if the purchaser
prefers, we perforate the backs also.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>The cost of Durand-Steel Lockers
is no more than that of first-class
wooden lockers</b>, and they last as long
as the building, are sanitary, secure, and,
in addition, are fire-proof.</p>

<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><span class='under'>Standard Policy</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c004'>A Standard Quality must be inseparably linked to a Standard Policy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Without a definite and Standard Mercantile Policy, it is impossible for a manufacturer to long
maintain a Standard Quality.</p>

<p class='c005'>To market his goods through the jobber, a manufacturer must provide a profit for the jobber as
well as the retail dealer. To meet these conditions of Dual Profits, the manufacturer is obliged to
set a proportionately high list price on his goods to the consumer.</p>

<p class='c005'>To enable the glib salesman, when booking his orders, to figure out attractive profits to both the
jobber and retailer, these high list prices are absolutely essential; but their real purpose will have been
served when the manufacturer has secured his order from the jobber, and the jobber has secured his
order from the retailer.</p>

<p class='c005'>However, these deceptive high list prices are not fair to the consumer, who does not, and, in
reality, is not ever expected to pay these fancy list prices.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the season opens for the sale of such goods, with their misleading but alluring high list
prices, the retailer begins to realize his responsibilities, and grapples with the situation as best he
can, by offering “special discounts,” which vary with local trade conditions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under this system of merchandising, the profits to both the manufacturer and the jobber are
assured; but as there is no stability maintained in the prices to the consumer, the keen competition
amongst the local dealers invariably leads to a demoralized cutting of prices by which the profits of
the retailer are practically eliminated.</p>

<p class='c005'>This demoralization always reacts on the manufacturer. The jobber insists on lower, and still
lower, prices. The manufacturer, in his turn, meets this demand for the lowering of prices by the
only way open to him, viz.: the cheapening and degrading of the quality of his product.</p>

<p class='c005'>The foregoing conditions became so intolerable that, ten years ago, in 1899, A. G. Spalding
&amp; Bros. determined to rectify this demoralization in the Athletic Goods Trade, and inaugurated what
has since become known as “The Spalding Policy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Spalding Policy” eliminates the jobber entirely, so far as Spalding Goods are concerned,
and the retail dealer secures his supply of Spalding Athletic Goods direct from the manufacturer
under a restricted retail price arrangement by which the retail dealer is assured a fair, legitimate and
certain profit on all Spalding Athletic Goods, and the consumer is assured a Standard Quality and is
protected from imposition.</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Spalding Policy” is decidedly for the interest and protection of the users of Athletic Goods,
and acts in two ways:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>First</span>—The user is assured of genuine Official Standard Athletic Goods, and
the same fixed prices to everybody.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Second</span>—As manufacturers, we can proceed with confidence in purchasing at
the proper time, the very best raw materials required in the manufacture
of our various goods, well ahead of their respective seasons, and this enables
us to provide the necessary quantity and absolutely maintain the Spalding
Standard of Quality.</p>

<p class='c005'>All retail dealers handling Spalding Athletic Goods are required to supply consumers at our
regular printed catalogue prices—neither more nor less—the same prices that similar goods are sold
for in our New York, Chicago and other stores.</p>

<p class='c005'>All Spalding dealers, as well as users of Spalding Athletic Goods, are treated exactly alike, and no
special rebates or discriminations are allowed to anyone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Positively, nobody, not even officers, managers, salesmen or other employes of A. G. Spalding
&amp; Bros., or any of their relatives or personal friends, can buy Spalding Athletic Goods at a discount
from the regular catalogue prices.</p>

<p class='c005'>This, briefly, is the “Spalding Policy,” which has already been in successful operation for the
past ten years, and will be indefinitely continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>In other words, “The Spalding Policy” is a “square deal” for everybody.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c004'>An article that is universally given the appellation “<b>Standard</b>” is thereby
conceded to be the Criterion, to which are compared all other things of a similar nature.
For instance, the Gold Dollar of the United States is the Standard unit of currency,
because it must legally contain a specific proportion of pure gold, and the fact of its
being Genuine is <b>guaranteed</b> by the Government Stamp thereon. As a protection to
the users of this currency against counterfeiting and other tricks, considerable money
is expended in maintaining a Secret Service Bureau of Experts. Under the law, citizen
manufacturers must depend to a great extent upon Trade-Marks and similar devices
to protect themselves against counterfeit products—without the aid of “Government
Detectives” or “Public Opinion” to assist them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Consequently the “Consumer’s Protection” against misrepresentation and “inferior
quality” rests entirely upon the integrity and responsibility of the “Manufacturer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros. have, by their rigorous attention to “Quality,” for thirty-three
years, caused their Trade-Mark to become known throughout the world as a
Guarantee of Quality as dependable in their field as the U. S. Currency is in its field.</p>

<p class='c005'>The necessity of upholding the guarantee of the Spalding Trade-Mark and maintaining
the Standard Quality of their Athletic Goods, is, therefore, as obvious as is the
necessity of the Government in maintaining a Standard Currency.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus each consumer is not only insuring himself but also protecting other consumers
when he assists a Reliable Manufacturer in upholding his Trade-Mark and all
that it stands for. Therefore, we urge all users of our Athletic Goods to assist us in
maintaining the Spalding Standard of Excellence, by insisting that our Trade-Mark be
plainly stamped on all athletic goods which they buy, because without this precaution
our best efforts towards maintaining Standard Quality and preventing fraudulent
substitution will be ineffectual.</p>

<p class='c005'>Manufacturers of Standard Articles invariably suffer the reputation of being
high-priced, and this sentiment is fostered and emphasized by makers of “inferior
goods,” with whom low prices are the main consideration.</p>

<p class='c005'>A manufacturer of recognized Standard Goods, with a reputation to uphold and a
guarantee to protect, must necessarily have higher prices than a manufacturer of cheap
goods, whose idea of and basis for a claim for Standard Quality depends principally
upon the eloquence of the salesman.</p>

<p class='c005'>We know from experience that there is no quicksand more unstable than poverty
in quality—and we avoid this quicksand by Standard Quality.</p>
